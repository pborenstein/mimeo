# Phase 8: Consolidation Chronicles

## Entry 32: Phase 8 planned — consolidation to status/sync (2026-07-06)

**What**: Closed Phase 7 and planned Phase 8 after a whole-codebase design
review. Reframed mimeo as a fleet manager for domain-to-GitHub-Pages sites.

**Why**: The CLI grew by accretion — one verb per operational incident
(dns repair, fix https, template apply) — and the two inventories (`list`,
`registrar list`) never join, so fleet-level questions across 105 domains
have no command. Half the codebase is per-command copies of the same
fan-out/render plumbing, where the zero-results bug lived.

**How**: Four staged tasks in IMPLEMENTATION.md: (1) shared domain-operation
engine, (2) `mimeo status` cross-provider join, (3) `mimeo sync` convergence
with --dry-run, (4) gated E2E lane. Plus identity fix and carried-over
template parameterization. Full rationale and alternatives in DEC-021.

**Decisions**: DEC-021

**Files**: `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/CONTEXT.md`
